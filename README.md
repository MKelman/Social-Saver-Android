# Social-Saver-Android
Social-Saver is a mobile application I built for my CS 2340 class at Georgia Tech. Social-Saver is a social shopping app that allows users to post awesome deals they find locally/online. Once posted, their friends will be able to see the deals and locate them. With Google maps integration, we allow users to pinpoint deals for the locations of the deals. Social Saver for IOS and Android both use Parse as it's backend for user and deal persistency.

NOTE: This app was built before my summer internship at Possible Mobile and my most recent work at TEQ Charging. My knowledge of mobile development has changed dramatically since those two educational work experiences.
